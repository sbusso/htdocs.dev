Key principles distilled from the journeys of successful indie hackers like Pieter Levels (Levelsio), Marc Lou, and others in the Indie Hackers community.

## 1. Focus on Solving Real Problems

- Address specific, real-world issues
- Prioritize product design and user experience
- Create solutions people are willing to pay for
- Start by scratching your own itch

## 2. Start Small, Ship Fast, and Iterate

- Develop and launch MVPs quickly (aim for ~2 weeks)
- Keep initial feature set minimal and focused
- Gather user feedback and data to guide improvements
- Validate ideas early to avoid overcommitting resources

## 3. Use Known Technologies and Embrace Simplicity

- Utilize a lean tech stack you're familiar with (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS)
- Avoid complexity that slows down development
- Focus on the core essence of your product
- Say no to feature bloat and distractions
- Be resourceful

## 4. Monetize Early with a Simple, Compelling Offer

- Charge from day one if you're providing real value
- Offer a focused, unique selling proposition
- Keep pricing and plans simple and easy to understand
- Optimize for revenue to bootstrap and maintain control
- Use Stripe Checkout for seamless payments

## 5. Build an Engaged Audience

- Default to transparency, share your journey openly
- Craft a relatable and authentic personal brand
- Teach and create value for your target audience
- Foster a community around shared interests and challenges
- Leverage network effects:
	- Social media: X (Twitter), LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram
	- Paid advertising: Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Google Ads
	- Communities: Product Hunt, relevant forums, Discord
	- Content marketing: Show how your app works on the landing page

## 6. Focus on One Thing at a Time

- Pour your energy into one project until it succeeds or fails
- Avoid splitting focus between multiple products early on
- Give each product a fair shot by seeing it through
- Move on to the next idea only after achieving success or learning

## 7. Optimize for Lifestyle and Productivity

- Embrace a nomadic, low-overhead lifestyle
- Minimize responsibilities that don't serve your goals
- Prioritize health, fitness, and mental clarity
- Create an environment and routine conducive to focused work

## 8. Automate and Scale

- Implement tools and processes to automate operations
- Focus on growth and new projects without getting bogged down in day-to-day tasks
- Aim for high-margin, automated businesses (90% margin)

## 9 Persevere and Pivot

- Take action â€“ it's the best way to learn
- Test market fit quickly
- If an idea doesn't work, be prepared to move on to the next
- Iterate not just on products, but on ideas themselves

## Conclusion

- Show how your app works directly on the landing page
- When considering selling your business:
    - For automated businesses with 90% margins, selling at less than 3-4x annual profit may not be worthwhile
    - You can potentially earn the same amount by keeping the business for 3-4 years
    - Consider the long-term potential and passive income before selling
