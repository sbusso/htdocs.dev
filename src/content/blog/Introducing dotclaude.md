I'm excited to announce the launch of [.claude](https://claude.com/) - a curated directory that brings together the best tools, configurations, and resources for Claude Code, Anthropic's powerful agentic coding assistant.

## The Claude Code Revolution

If you haven't tried Claude Code yet, you're missing out on what might be the most significant shift in AI-assisted development since GitHub Copilot. Unlike traditional code completion tools, Claude Code is an agentic assistant that lives in your terminal, understands your entire codebase, and can handle complex, multi-step development tasks through natural language commands.

But here's the thing: while Claude Code is incredibly powerful out of the box, its true potential unlocks when you configure it properly and connect it to the right tools. That's where most developers get stuck.

## The Problem We're Solving

After spending months working with Claude Code across different projects, I noticed a common pattern. Developers would:

1. **Struggle with initial setup** - Claude Code works best with proper CLAUDE.md configuration files, but finding good examples was scattered across GitHub repos and blog posts
2. **Miss out on powerful integrations** - The Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem has exploded with 200+ tools, but discovering and configuring them was a nightmare
3. **Reinvent the wheel** - Everyone was creating their own slash commands and workflows instead of sharing proven patterns

## Enter .claude

**[.claude](https://dotclaude.com/)** is my attempt to solve these problems by creating a comprehensive, beautifully organized directory of everything you need to supercharge your Claude Code workflow.

### üõ†Ô∏è **200+ MCP Tools & Servers**

From GitHub integration and PostgreSQL databases to Slack automation and AWS management - we've cataloged the entire ecosystem of Claude Code extensions. Each tool includes:

- Clear descriptions of capabilities
- Installation instructions
- Category filtering (Development, Database, Cloud, AI Services, etc.)
- Direct links to repositories

### ‚öôÔ∏è **50+ CLAUDE.md Templates**

Ready-to-use configuration templates for every project type:

- **Framework-specific**: React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, Python/FastAPI
- **Language setups**: Go, Rust, Python with proper tooling
- **Workflow templates**: TDD, GitHub automation, deployment pipelines
- **Universal templates**: Adaptable for any project type

### ‚ú® **What Makes It Special**

- **Authentic Claude design** - Built with Claude's actual brand colors and design system
- **Smart categorization** - Find exactly what you need with intuitive filtering
- **Copy-paste ready** - All configurations are production-tested and ready to use
- **Community-driven** - Sourced from the best practices across the Claude Code community

## Real Impact

Since I started using properly configured Claude Code with the right MCP tools, my development workflow has transformed:

- **Issue resolution** that used to take 45+ minutes now happens in a single Claude session
- **Documentation generation** is completely automated
- **Testing workflows** follow TDD patterns that Claude executes flawlessly
- **Deployment processes** are handled end-to-end with simple natural language commands

The difference between default Claude Code and a properly configured setup is like the difference between Notepad and VS Code.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. The Claude Code ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and I'm committed to keeping .claude as the definitive resource. Upcoming features include:

- **Community contributions** - Submit your own tools and configs
- **Integration guides** - Step-by-step tutorials for complex setups
- **Workflow examples** - Real-world development scenarios
- **Best practices** - Lessons learned from production usage
